# Contributing to react-floodgate

## Setup

This project uses [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) as its package manager; it is highly recommended that contributors use Yarn if possible.

1. Fork and clone the repo
2. Run `yarn` to install dependencies
3. Create a branch for your PR

### Creating a branch

When creating a branch, please adhere to the following branch name specification:

`{username}/{branch_name}`

Where:

- `{username}`: your Github username
- `{branch_name}`: desdcriptive branch name in camelCase

This makes it clear 1. who is making the PR and 2. what problem is being solved/feature being added/etc when reviewing PRs on Github.

## Creating a Pull Request

After you have forked the repo and created a feature branch, you can submit a [pull request](https://github.com/geoffdavis92/react-floodgate/pulls) directly to this repo.

## Yarn scripts

Any `yarn`/`npm` scripts run locally-installed CLI binaries, so there is no worry about making sure your global binaries of the tools used are up to date. Note, this project primarily uses `yarn`, which is recommended, so ensuring Yarn is properly installed and up-to-date is important in the development process.

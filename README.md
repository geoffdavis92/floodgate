<p align="center">Configurable and flexible React component for incrementally displaying data.</p>

## The motivation

I have worked on a few client sites and side projects where serialized data is to be displayed concatenated to a given length, with the ability to load more entries after a respective user interaction. 

This can easily result in a complicated mixture of `Array.splice`-ing, potential data mutation, and overly complicated component methods.

Surely there can be a more elegant solution?

## This solution

Enter `react-floodgate`; like its namesake, this component allows for the precise control of rendering serialized data.

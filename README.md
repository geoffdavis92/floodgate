## The motivation

I have worked on a few client sites and side projects where serialized data is to be displayed concatenated to a given length, with the ability to load more entries after a respective user interaction. 

This can easily result in a complicated mixture of `Array.splice`-ing, potential data mutation, and overly complicated component methods.

Surely there can be a more elegant solution?

## This solution

Enter `react-floodgate`; like its namesake, this component allows for the precise and safe control of resources. Using an [ES2015 generator function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function*) as the control mechanism and the [function-as-child](http://mxstbr.blog/2017/02/react-children-deepdive/#function-as-a-child) pattern for flexible and developer-controlled rendering, one can load serialized data into `react-floodgate`, render their desired components, and safely and programmatically iterate through the data as needed.
